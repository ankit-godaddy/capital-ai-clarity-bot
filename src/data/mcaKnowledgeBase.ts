      answer: `**Your offers are based on:**

• Other business criteria evaluated by our funding partners

**General guideline:** The longer you've been trading with us and the higher your monthly revenue, the better your offers will be.

**Example scenario:** If you have an e-commerce business averaging $10,000 monthly sales and have been in business for 12 months, you could potentially be eligible for $12,000 in funding with a flat fee and a percentage of daily sales for repayment.

Your specific offers will be clearly displayed when you apply, showing the exact terms available to you.`

    fees_and_rates: {
      keywords: ['fees', 'interest', 'cost', 'rate', 'percentage', 'interest rate', 'apr', 'annual percentage rate', 'charges', 'no interest'],
      answer: `**GoDaddy Capital MCA Fees:**
• **Only a flat fee** - No interest rates
• **No additional charges** - The flat fee is agreed upon at origination
• **Not charged upfront** - The fee becomes part of your total repayment amount
• **Transparent pricing** - You'll see exact terms before accepting

**Example:**
If you receive a $6,000 MCA with a $900 flat fee:
- Total repayment amount: $6,900
- If your payment rate is 20% and daily sales are $1,000
- Daily payment: $200 (until $6,900 is fully repaid)

**No surprises:** All terms are clearly disclosed upfront with complete transparency.`

  repayment: {
    how_repayment_works: {
      keywords: ['repay', 'payment', 'how to pay', 'automatic'],
      answer: `**Automatic Repayment Process:**
Payments happen automatically as a **fixed percentage of your daily sales**.

**How it works:**
• A predetermined percentage of your daily sales is automatically deducted
• Deductions come from your GoDaddy Payments cash flow
• Pay more when sales are high, less when sales are low
• No payments on days with no sales

**Example:**
- MCA amount: $6,000 + $900 fee = $6,900 total
- Payment rate: 20% of daily sales
- Day 1: $1,000 sales = $200 payment
- Day 2: $1,100 sales = $220 payment  
- Day 3: $0 sales = $0 payment

This flexible system adapts to your business cycle automatically.`
    },
    payment_length: {
      keywords: ['how long', 'payment period', 'duration', 'minimum payment'],
      answer: `**Payment Terms:**
• **No minimum payment amount** - Each payment is calculated as a percentage of daily sales
• **No fixed timeline** - Payment length depends on your sales volume
• **Flexible duration** - Higher sales = faster payoff, slower sales = longer payoff
• **No set schedule** - Payments only occur when you have sales

**Typical timeframe:** Based on sales history and other factors, most MCAs are structured to be paid back in approximately 6-8 months.

**Key benefit:** Since payments are tied to your sales, you'll never struggle with fixed payments during slow periods.`
    },
    missed_payments: {
      keywords: ['miss payment', 'late fees', 'penalties', 'no sales'],
      answer: `**No Penalties for Slow Sales:**
• **No set payment schedule** - If your business has no sales on a particular day, there's no payment that day
• **No late fees** - Since payments are tied to sales, there are no traditional "late" payments
• **No penalties** - The system is designed to work with your business cycle

**Monitoring:** Our funding partners track payments over longer periods (weekly/monthly) to ensure they're within expected ranges. If your cash flow decreases significantly, they'll work with you to adjust terms and help ensure successful repayment.

**Flexibility:** This system provides much more flexibility than traditional loans with fixed payment schedules.`
    },
    prepayment: {
      keywords: ['prepay', 'early payment', 'pay off early', 'penalty'],
      answer: `**Prepayment Options:**
• **Yes, you can prepay** the advance without any penalty
• **Early one-off payments** are allowed without additional charges
• **No prepayment fees**

**Important note:** There's typically no financial incentive to prepay early because you're paying the same flat fee regardless of when the MCA is fully repaid. Most merchants prefer the flexibility of the automatic percentage-based payments that adjust to their cash flow.

You have complete flexibility to manage your repayment as needed for your business.`
